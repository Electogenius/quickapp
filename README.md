# quickapp

a simple badly made javascript library that helps in making small web-apps with vanilla javascript

```js
Q();                            //initialize library

$h1("This creates a heading");
$$p();                          // $$elementname creates the element and goes inside it
    $span("This is some")
    $b("strong green", "style=color:green")
    $span("text.")
end                             // exits paragraph
```

thats about it
